My Advent of Code scribbles

## Description

This is a repo that contains my scribbles of [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019), which happens every year.

## Usage

Every day has a directory labeled accordingly, for example day 1 is under directory day1. So far there are no tests or anything fancy.
Under each directory there is a main.go that you can run via `go run main.go`, this main package relies on fmt-ing the required output to pass the day challenge.
